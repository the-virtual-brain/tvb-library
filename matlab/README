MATLAB interface to TVB
-----------------------

This is an interface to TVB. Please add this folder to your MATLAB path
and then work through vb_test.m (preferably with MATLAB Editor's 
cell mode), to see how it should work and to test your own installation.

In principle, this should work from any recent MATLAB, interacting with
the standard distribution of TVB. 

Currently, data is saved somewhere on the local computer, so this interface
won't work over a network, but this would be possible in the future.

If you are not using the standard distribution of TVB, but rather just the
scientific_library, you just need to make sure you've got cherrypy and h5py 
installed. Prefer using pip, your package manger may not get the most
recent versions. You may then launch the tvb/api/http.py file to start
the server.

For the moment, Octave is not supported, but this would be easily remedied
by writing a function to shell out to wget/curl to do the HTTP calls. Please
submit such a function if you write it.
